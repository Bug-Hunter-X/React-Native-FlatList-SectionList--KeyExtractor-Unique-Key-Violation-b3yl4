In React Native, when working with FlatList or SectionList, an uncommon error arises when the `keyExtractor` function doesn't provide unique keys for each item in the data array.  This can lead to inconsistent rendering, unexpected behavior, and performance issues.  For example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }, { id: 1, name: 'Item 3' }]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

Here, the `keyExtractor` uses `item.id`, but the id `1` is duplicated, violating the uniqueness requirement. This often manifests as items not updating correctly or disappearing unexpectedly.
